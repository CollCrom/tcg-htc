# Skeptic Memory

Persistent learnings across sessions. Update this after each review.

## Recurring Bugs Found

- **Base vs modified values**: Code frequently uses `card.definition.power` or `card.definition.keywords` instead of querying the EffectEngine for modified values. Always check that game logic uses `effect_engine.get_modified_power/defense/keywords()` — not raw definition fields. Found in: Phantasm defender power check, Go Again snapshotting at play time instead of resolution time.
- **Zone cleanup after destruction**: When equipment is destroyed (Blade Break, Temper), it must be removed from the equipment slot AND moved to graveyard. The close_chain method must skip already-destroyed equipment to avoid restoring it to its slot.
- **Damage source attribution**: Damage must be attributed to `event.source.owner_index`, not inferred as `1 - target_player`. Self-damage effects (Blood Debt) would be wrong otherwise.

## Patterns to Watch For

- Any new keyword check that reads `card.definition.X` directly — should it use the effect engine instead?
- Any new zone transition — does it clean up all references (equipment slots, combat chain, stack)?
- Any new damage event — does it set the source correctly for counter tracking?
